# Active View and View Depth

The DateRangePicker enables you to define the first and last initial views as well as the last view to which the user can navigate.

To define the first view that the DateRangePicker initially renders, use the `start` option.

The following options are available for the `start` property:
* `month`&mdash;Shows the days of the month.
* `year`&mdash;Shows the months of the year.
* `decade`&mdash;Shows the years of the decade.
* `century`&mdash;Shows the decades of the century.

```html-preview
<div id="vueapp" class="vue-app">
    <kendo-daterangepicker :start="'year'"
                           :depth="'month'">
    </kendo-daterangepicker>
</div>
```
```js
Vue.use(DateinputsInstaller);
new Vue({
	el: '#vueapp'
})
```
